			<p id="bodyText">I am a born and raised Calgarian that has a passion for photography. As I was growing up, I saw early youtube vidoes and realized what could be done with just a camera 
								as I was seeing people creating amazing cinematics with a point and shoot and a little editing. Once I got a hold of a camera I was able to express
								my perspective and self in a way I never could before. </p>
